# Rust-chat

I wrote this small chat-like pair of server/client in order to learn Rust (borrow-checker,
lifelines, threads, generics). Rust is kinda hard at first glance (lots of syntax) but its
approach in tooling and language is extremely interesting.

ðŸ˜Ž **Pros:**

- No GC but memory-safe
- some good FP constructs (maps for example), nice
- type-oriented language, no bloated classes or objets
- polymorphism and generics implemented in a nice way (`impl trait`) where you can add
  traits to a foreign type (traits are like interfaces)
- pretty good type inference but still needs lots of annotations (function params and some
  generic functions). But I know that inference is hard when using polymorphism

ðŸ˜ž **Cons:**

- language and tooling is evolving at a fast pace; although transitionning between patch/minor version
  is often painless, maintaing a Rocket (for example) project is a pain as it uses
  the `nightly` channel, which in turn often lacks some tooling randomly (`rls` mainly)
- The tooling, primarely `rls` (Rust Language Server), is young and somehow the types-on-hover
  doesn't work great (compared to OCaml, ReasonML or even Typescript). Because of the trait stuff,
  the RLS often doesn't give which methods can be called or stuff like that.
- Compiler a bit slow compared to Go or OCaml but faster than template-based C++

To test this small POC:

    cargo run -- server 9000
    cargo run -- client 127.0.0.1 9000
    cargo run -- client 127.0.0.1 9000
