// Deck of Cards: 
// --------------
// 
// Problem definition
// Blackjack is one of the most played games in casinos. In this game, several players play against the dealer. 
// The objective of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding the 21 points. This game 
// is played with a deck of cards. Each card has a specific value associated with it, and these values are compared. 
// The value of an ace card can be 1 or 11 points while cards of 10, Jack, Queen, and King value 10 points. 
// Whereas, cards 2-9 have the same values as the number written on them. Hence, the player having one ace and a 
// face card (King, Queen, or Jack card.) or a 10 card has 21 points. This is called Blackjack.
//
// At the start of the game, a bet is placed by a player, and then the dealer will create hands (Each player and 
// the dealer get two cards each.). All players have both cards exposed while the dealer has one card exposed 
// and one card hidden. Now, both the dealer and the player can hit (Draw an additional card.) a card and ensure 
// that they should not get over 21. Anyone exceeding 21 points, busts and loses the bet. The player can stand pat 
// (Stop taking cards) at any time. When a player stops taking cards, if the player has more points than the dealer 
// but less than 22, they win the bet.
// 
// 
// Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. 
// Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.
